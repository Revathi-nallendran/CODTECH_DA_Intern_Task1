# TASK 1
# Exploratory Data Analysis For Restaurant Dataset (EDA)

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for a comprehensive restaurant dataset. The 'dataset.csv' file includes detailed information on 9,551 restaurants from various locations, with attributes such as restaurant ID, name, location, cuisine type, average cost for two, ratings, and more.

## Project Overview

The EDA aims to uncover insights and trends in the restaurant industry. The analysis includes:

   - Distribution details of categorical columns (e.g., City, Cuisines, Has Table booking)

2. **Missing Values Analysis:** 
   - Identification and handling of missing values

3. **Correlation Analysis:** 
   - Computation of the correlation matrix for numerical variables

4. **Visualizations:** 
   - Histograms for numerical columns
   - Bar plots for categorical columns
   - Box plots to highlight distribution and potential outliers

## Requirements

- pandas
- matplotlib
