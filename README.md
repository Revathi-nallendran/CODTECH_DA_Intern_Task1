TASK 01  
Restaurant Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for a comprehensive restaurant dataset. The dataset, dataset.csv, includes detailed information on 9,551 restaurants from various locations. Key attributes of the dataset include restaurant ID, name, location, cuisine type, average cost for two, ratings, and more.

Project Overview:

The EDA performed on this dataset aims to uncover insights and trends in the restaurant industry. The analysis includes:

1.Summary Statistics:    
  Descriptive statistics for numerical columns such as Average Cost for two, Aggregate rating, and Votes.
Distribution details of categorical columns like City, Cuisines, and Has Table booking.

2.Missing Values Analysis:  
Identification and handling of missing values within the dataset.

3.Correlation Analysis:  
    Computation of the correlation matrix to understand the relationships between numerical variables.

4.Visualizations:  
  Histograms for numerical columns to visualize the distribution of data points.
Bar plots for categorical columns to show the frequency of different categories.
Box plots to highlight the distribution and potential outliers in numerical columns.

Usage:  

The EDA script can be executed to generate insights and visualizations. 
Make sure to have the required Python packages installed before running the script.

Requirements:  

1.pandas  
2.matplotlib.

Files:  

dataset.csv: The main dataset containing restaurant information.
